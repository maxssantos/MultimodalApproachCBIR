## Abstract
Retrieving similar images from large databases is a complex task for the human being. The purpose of this work is to use one technique for extracting and combining the image descriptors (texture, color and/or shape) to enrich content-based image retrieval in the context of medical images. To analyze the proposed technique, a proprietary dataset, composed by skin ulcers images, will be used. Given a query image will be calculated the accuracy and recall of the content-based image retrieving, as a form of evaluation of the proposed technique. All this work will be implemented in the Python language.

## Description of Input Images
The chosen dataset, to apply the proposed technique, is a set of proprietary images provided to the ICMC/USP Data Bases and Images Group (GBDI) by the Clinical Hospital of the Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School. This dataset is composed of 217 colored dermatological images, with skin ulcers originated from both venous and arterial insufficiencies, and the images were labeled by specialists in the following classes: granulation (G), fibrin (F), callous (C) and necrotic tissue (N).

## Steps
The following steps are proposed to achieve the goal:

### 1. Image Descriptors Extraction
An image descriptor (color, texture or shape) is composed of (i) characteristics vector and (ii) distance function. In this work, will be implemented and used the Border/Interior Classification (BIC) as color's descriptor of the image, and the Local binary patterns (LBP) as texture's descriptor of the image.

### 2. Descriptors Combination
The combination of the descriptors will be performed with the concatenation between the color and texture vectors of a given image and the with the euclidian distance function, aplied as similarity function between two images.

### 3. Recovery of K Similar Images
In this step, given a query image (Img) and an integer value (K). The program will return the K images most similar to Img, using the k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm.

### 4. Accuracy and Recall Calculation
In this final step, the program will calculate the precision (number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier) and the recall (number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples, ie, all samples that should have been identified as positive).

## Program
There are two programs:
1. 'code/extractor/feature_extractor.py': responsible for extracting the descriptors (color and texture) of the images set
2. 'code/cbir/skin_ulcer_cbir.py': responsible for (i) combining the feature vectors (color and shape), (ii) calculating the distances between the query image for all other images and (iii) returning the most similar images to the query image.

The file 'code/extractor/feature_extractor_bib.py' contains a set of functions (created by the author) that are important and necessary for extracting the images descriptors. This file is imported by both files described previously.
