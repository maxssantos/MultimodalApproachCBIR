Abstract: Retrieving similar images from large databases is a complex task for the human being. The purpose of this work is to use one technique for extracting and combining the texture, color and/or shape descriptors of image to enrich content-based image retrieval in the context of medical images. To analyze the proposed technique, a proprietary dataset will be used, provided to the ICMC/USP Data Bases and Images Group (GBDI) by the Clinical Hospital of the Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School. This dataset is composed of 217 dermatological images, with skin ulcers originated from both venous and arterial insufficiencies. In order to evaluate the results will be calculated precision and recall of the similar image retrieval process given a query image. Given a query image will be calculated the accuracy and recall of the content-based image retrieving, as a form of evaluation of the proposed technique.
